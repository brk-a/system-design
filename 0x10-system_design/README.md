# 0x10 system design
* revisit the basics of system design
* little to no code; idea is to *"glue together"* technologies to form as efficient a system as possible

## flow
* computer architecture (disk storage, RAM, cache, CPU)
* production app architecture (CI/CD, load balancers, logging & monitoring)
* design requirements (CAP theorem, throughput, latency, SLOs and SLAs)
* networking (TCP, UDP, DNS, IP addresses & IP headers)
* application layer protocols (HTTP, webSockets, WebRTC, MQTT etc)
* API design
* caching and CDNs
* proxy servers (forward/reverse proxies)
* load balancers
* databases (sharding, replication, ACID, vertical & horizontal scaling)
